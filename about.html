    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Matthew Burkett and I'm a computer science major at Michigan State University. While I did choose to make this blog
        about reading, I've only just recently picked it up as a hobby. For the last few months I've read (and reread) most of C.S. Lewis'
        most popular books. I've really been enjoying him as an author because he sees a lot of things in a way similar to how I see them.
        His approach to theology, apologetics, storytelling, and fantastic worlds is something that I really appreciate. The only other
        author I've been reading has been Dostoyevsky. It's remarkable that in his books which I've read so far, regardless of the type of
        character he describes, I can see that character as a part of myself. He does a brilliant job at tackling psychological and
        sociological questions in his fiction. The works of these authors is exactly the kind of thing I aspire to create in my own prefered
        artistic medium. I want to create games with the same kind of artistic value which inspires me.
