            <h3 class="article-title">Till We Have Faces by C.S. Lewis</h3>
            <address>Written by Matthew Burkett - <p><time datetime="2021--10-28 5:50">5:50</time></p> PM</address>
            <p><img src="TillWeHaveFaces.jpg" alt="Cover of Till We Have Faces"></p>
            <p>
                I've heard that Lewis considered this to be one of his best books. I would say it's probably one of the best fiction books I've
                ever read. The story, which is a retelling of an ancient Greek myth, is about a queen named Orual who is writing to make her case
                against the "god of the mountain," who she believes wronged her.
            </p>
            <p>
                The story begins by describing how she grew up with a kind and innocent sister, Psyche, and a wise mentor who is nicknamed "the
                fox." Her father was a king who was fierce, though pious. Orual feared him except in the presence of the Priest of Ungit who could
                get the king to follow almost any command fearfully. In a period of great misfortune for the kingdom, the priest conveys that Ungit
                wants Psyche to be offered as a sacrifice. The king yeilds to even this command, leaving his own daughter at the top of a mountain
                for a legendary monster (who serves Ungit) to take her away.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because I don't want to spoil the story, I won't say much more about it. Orual, despite believing that Psyche's salvation was all
                she desired, realizes that, after discovering Psyche alive and well, married to a mysterious god on the mountain she was left at,
                she only really wanted Psyche to herself. A loss of Psyche to this god was the same as a loss of Psyche by death.
            </p>
            <p>
                The author creatively explores themes of humanity and the justifications and misinterpretations we give to the corrupt parts of
                ourselves. Indeed, as Orual does finally realize, we can't make our true case "<i>till we have faces</i>."

            <h3 class="article-title">Notes from the Underground by Fyodor Dostoyevsky</h3>
            <address>Written by Matthew Burkett - <time datetime="2021--10-28 6:20">6:20</time> PM</address>
            <p><img src="NotesFromTheUnderground.jpg" alt="Cover of Notes from the Underground"></p>
            <p>
                Notes from the Underground is about the worst kind of man, as the underground man admits about himself. This anonymous character has
                left society to live underground so that he could think and write about his condition. He lacks all confidence, but is unaware of
                this because of how boldly he makes a fool of himself as he's always on the defensive. By consequence he lacks any faith in his own
                ability to cause pain to others and in his ability to even strive for the "ideal" or "good." As a result, he has never cultivated
                tenderness towards others within himself and has never strived beyond his low standard for himself. The underground man never
                recognizes this about himself. Instead he explains his behaviors by stating that he is a "petty man." After writing about this idea a
                bit more, he quickly changes his mind, insisting that he is not petty. Rather than expanding on this, he leaves it there, willfully
                ignoring the potentially dangerous ideas that might come of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I won't write about the things that the underground man did that were so awful as to make him "the worst kind of man" (you can read the
                book if you want to learn more) but that's fine because, as I understand it, Notes from the Underground is a commentary on a certain
                psychological state or worldview. What I found remarkable is how many of the things said by the underground man were also thought by me
                at times when I wasn't particularly mentally healthy or before I had learned an important lesson. It's humbling to realize that this
                character often represented parts of myself. While this book might be difficult to read through, it's very much worth reading.
